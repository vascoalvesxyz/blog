	<p>Despite the lack of reading that is to be expected of the digital age, we place books, information, knowledge, reason in general, on a high pedestal.
On pure philosophical first principle, I believe you shouldn&rsquo;t immediately turn to a book, to a prompt, to a search; choosing instead to always prioritize yourself, your own judgement, instincts and reason: refining them whenever possible. To be always searching for knowledge and yet to be completely hostile to it.</p>
<p>You see, it takes a certain kind of person to arrogantly dismiss good reasoning and sound logic because of personal taste.
Some ideas don&rsquo;t deserve me. Should I believe something just because it makes the most &ldquo;logical&rdquo; sense?
Pure determinism makes sense, it&rsquo;s a direct consequence of cause and effect.
Free will can&rsquo;t be proven. Still, there&rsquo;s something about the idea of fatalistic pure hard-wired determinism
that turns people off. It these circumstances it becomes good to be purposefully ignorant, to be stupid, to care only about your state of mind.</p>
<p>Philosophy is a confession, someones thought process striped naked.
I would even extend that to all artistic expression.
What kind of book, painting, song is not a confession from it&rsquo;s author?
Art naturally produces idealogical self-replication, it can hardly be avoided.
You cannot easily forget yourself, even with clever lies your presuppositions
are embedded in your reasoning itself, you would have to entirely forget how you think.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>hygiene</strong> that is necessary when dealing with foreign ideas.</p>
<p>Ideas are more than just logical arguments, they can be linked to an author.
The author of the idea is important. How are you related to him? Do you vibe with him?
Does he at least provide a synthesis or an antithesis for your beliefs?</p>
<p>Beliefs aren&rsquo;t meant to be universal truths.
What I believe in is the most adapted to me.
That&rsquo;s the real message here.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t trust other people to think for you, no matter how many centuries ago they lived or how many
PHDs and TedTalks they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
