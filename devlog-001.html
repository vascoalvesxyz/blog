        <h1>Devlog 001</h1>

        <p>AI is the new NFT: it looks like magic, it feels like magic and it runs on
        technology that most people don't understand. But this could be said
        of most technology, the difference is that generative AI and NFT's are more of a magic
        trick than genius technological advancement. The underlying technology,
        in this case, machine learning and block chain technology, have other
        more interesting and useful applications. But the general population
        can't be sold facial recognition software and cryptocurrencies. A magic
        black box that answers all your questions directly, however --- that's 
        infinitely more interesting, even if it's a cheap trick.</p>

        <p>Chat bots have been around for at least a decades, that's as far as I
        remember them, just not with hundreds of millions of dollars in backing.</p>

        <p>They really took the idea of a million monkeys typing out Shakespeare's work
        and said: <em>Hmmm, I know, maybe with a billion monkeys it will work!</p>

        <h3>AI's Failure to teach</h3>

        <p>AI's inability to teach does not correlate with the user's ability
        to learn.</h3>

        <p>Imagine knowledge as a chain of dependencies. To learn something more
        advanced, you need to learn the basics, the principles, the fundamentals.
        That was until general artificial intelligence came around and said ---
        <em>you don't have to ask for help from seniors, professors or read
            forums, articles or books, I will do all of that for you.</em>
        Except not really, because all it does is create a word salad based
        on your prompt. It doesn't care to explain or to teach. And if you
        are using A.I. in the first place, you probably didn't mean to learn
        but to escape learning something you see as menial and trivial.</p>

        <p>Learning something from the outside and trying to REVERSE-ENGINEER
        THE ACTUAL PRINCIPALS is a HUGE WASTE OF TIME. It would be better to 
        learn the principals first and maybe then theorize a bit of where they will
        take you. The kind of backwards learning that A.I. normally leads people
        to makes them even more DEPENDENT on it! Furthermore, it creates a 
        false understanding, it's the different between knowing the answers
        and knowing how to answer them.</p>

        <p>Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.</p>

        <p>Giving people the answers, only makes them delusional in themselves.</p>

        <h3>AI as an averaging machine</h3>

        Generative AI is a statistical model trained on data. It can't create
        anything original, anything new or anything meaningful. It can only
        sloppily predict what it should say or do based on what you ask. 
        There is no thinking, only data and non-deterministic predictions. 

        IT IS THE AVERAGING OF THE AVERAGE, THE MIDDLE DOWN THE MIDDLER, MEDIOCRITY
        MADE ALGORITHM.

        It's everything I hate! The path of least resistance that leads to nothing.
        Neither entertainment nor information. Not good enough to be copy and 
        pasted, not bad enough to be obviously wrong. At least humans can be taught
        and corrected.

        It works perfectly until it doesn't, things have always been like this,
        but now that we don't write our own stuff, we can't fix our own stuff.
